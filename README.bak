About:
------

WINSERVER - Wildcat! Interactive Net Server or Wildcat! for short, is an
advanced  RPC client/server hosting platform. The client API to the
server is available for the following languages:

    - Microsoft C/C++
    - Microsoft .Net Languages,
      - C#
      - VB.NET
      - Managed C++
      - COM/ATL
    - wcBASIC
    - Python (wcPython, wcpapi)
    - PHP (wcPHP, wcPHPLite)
    - Java (wcJava)
    - Delphi (wcDelphi)
    - VB (wcVB)

Legacy Languages: Obsolete and is no longer supported.

    - Microsoft C/C++ v4.0 for 16 bit.
    - Visual Fox Pro
    - Delphi 16 bit.

-------------------
32 vs 64 bit Notes:
-------------------

- Wildcat! originated as a pure 32bit RPC client/server system.
  Starting with v8.0, a 64 bit server is available along with 32 bit
  client side tools. All client-side modules related to hosting and
  running WCX applications remain in 32 bit until 32 bit inline asm
  is replaced with 64 bit op code processing.

- Any .Net application written in VB.NET or C# much be compiled to
  target 32 bit or Any CPU since the imported *.dll are 32 bit.


------------------
Future Projects:
------------------

- Create .Net DLL library to target 64 bit.

- Provide projects using other compilers such as the community edition
  of Visual Studio.
