I am about in embark (again) on another Git Transition/Migration effort,
only this time in earnest, to correspond with my new V8.0 production.

My system is pretty large, once upon at time, at least 10 programmers
with a layout as such:

   \local\wc#\project|component|module|etc-folder

where # is the major version number following by folders/directories that
are project, module, component oriented.

For example:


   \local\wc8\wcserver
   \local\wc8\wconline
   \local\wc8\wcoftp
   \local\wc8\wcotelnt
   \local\wc8\wcohttp
   \local\wc8\wcmodem
   \local\wc8\common
   \local\wc8\include
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\cpp
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\cpp\common
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\cpp\include
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\cpp\API
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\c#
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\vb.net
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver\delphi
   \local\wc8\wcsdk\help

For git, I am looking to begin with the wcSDK folder, although I am know thinking
perhaps i can start with \local and then have sub git repositories, which is directly
relate to my question.   How should lay this out?

Overall, when I first created the WCSDK repos,  GitHub then displayed
first time instructions:

    echo "# WcSDK" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/hlsantos/WcSDK.git
    git push -u origin master

So locally, I did the following:

    cd \local\wc8\wcsdk
    git init
    git add README.md    (I created one)
    git add help
    git add wcserver     (this took a long time)

and realized, that git create the repo for the entire help and wcserver
folders.  I was not sure if that was desirable.  Instead, would the following
work as well:


    cd \local\wc8\wcsdk
    git init
    git add README.md    (I created one)


    cd \local\wc8\wcsdk\help
    git init
    git add * or individual files

    cd \local\wc8\wcsdk\wcserver
    git init
    git add * or individual files


How does git handle this?  when clone, checking out the WCSDK repo?  Will it do the
sub-folders as done above?
