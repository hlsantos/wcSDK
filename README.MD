WINSERVER - Wildcat! Interactive Net Server or Wildcat! for short, is an
advanced  RPC client/server hosting platform. The client API to the
server is available for the following languages:

    - Microsoft C/C++
    - Microsoft .Net Languages,
      - C#
      - VB.NET
      - Managed C++
      - COM/ATL
    - PHP
    - Java
    - Delphi
    - wcBASIC

Legacy Languages: Obsolete and is no longer supported.

    - Microsoft C/C++ v4.0 for 16 bit.
    - Visual Fox Pro
    - Delphi 16 bit.

-------------------
32 vs 64 bit Notes:
-------------------

- Wildcat! originated as a pure 32bit client/server system.  Starting with
  v8.0, a 64 bit server is available along with 64 bit client side tools.
  All client-side modules related to hosting and running WCX applications
  remain in 32 bit only.

- Any .Net application written in VB.NET or C# much be compiled to target
  32 bit since the imported *.dll are 32 bit.


------------------
Future Projects:
------------------

- Create .Net DLL library to target 64 bit.

- Provide projects using other compilers such as the community edition of VS.
