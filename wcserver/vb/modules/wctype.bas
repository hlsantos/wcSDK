'//! SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT LONG vs SHORT FILE NAMES
'//!
'//! - v5.5 - File Database Only
'//!
'//!    MAX_PATH long file name support was implemented in v5.5
'//!    Database conversion was required since TFileRecord size
'//!    was changed
'//!
'//! - v6.1.451.9 - Message Database Only (Native storage)
'//!
'//!   A 80 (79 + 1 null) semi-long file name was implemented
'//!   in v6.1.451.9 for TMsgHeader.Attachment.  The old
'//!   short file name field was renamed to TMsgHeader.AttachmentSFN
'//!
'//!   Developers can use a sizeof(TMsgHeader.Header) check to see
'//!   what is the current size of the API.
